Fix `bun.lock`'s cached `workspaces[path].version` fields going stale after `changeset version` bumps a workspace package's version. `bun install` alone does not refresh that field for an unrelated dependency-graph change (a version bump with no dependency changes), so `bun pm pack` kept resolving internal `workspace:*` references to the old (or, once genuinely stale enough, a bogus `0.0.0`) version at publish time — this is what broke the `0.0.2` publish of `@agent-dev-lab/cli` and `@agent-dev-lab/web`, whose `@agent-dev-lab/core` dependency resolved to a nonexistent `0.0.0`.

`scripts/patch-lock.ts` now runs as part of the `version` script and rewrites `bun.lock`'s workspace version fields directly from each workspace's `package.json`, independent of `bun install`'s incremental update behavior.
